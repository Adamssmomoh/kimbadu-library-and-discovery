Our childrenâ€™s favorite books are those that reflect Sierra Leonean cultureâ€”where they can recognize themselves and their stories. Unfortunately, we donâ€™t have enough of these, and there are also very limited puzzles or games to play. This makes it difficult to create a fun and engaging learning environment for the youngest learners.",
